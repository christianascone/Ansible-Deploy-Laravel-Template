- [x] python
- [x] ansible

## **:wrench: Developer usage**

### **Set up project**

Before cloning the repo **be sure** you have installed:

- [**PYTHON**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version >= 2)
- [**ANSIBLE**](https://www.ansible.com/) (version >= 2.9.x)

Then:

- Choose a folder project in your system and switch in `cd [folder path]`
- Clone the repo in your folder path `git clone https://github.com/christianascone/Ansible-Deploy-Laravel-Template.git`

---

### **Configuration**

In order to install the project you must clone this repo one level above your laravel app.

For example:
```
|
+-- Ansible-Deploy-Laravel/
|
+-- app/
|  +-- app/
|  +-- public/
|  +-- .env
```

Then go inside the `Ansible-Deploy-Laravel` directory and run the setup script:
```sh
./setup.sh
```
This will just copy example files as real configuration files.

Now you can edit them with your setup:
```
|
+-- group_vars/
|  +-- all.yml  <--
|
+-- inventories/
|  +-- testing/
|  |  +-- hosts  <--
|  |  +-- group_vars/
|  |  |  +-- all.yml  <--
|  +-- production/
|  |  +-- hosts  <--
|  |  +-- group_vars/
|  |  |  +-- all.yml  <--
```


Place your `.env` files in path you set in `all.yml`.

---

### Start the project

Go inside the `Ansible-Deploy-Laravel` directory and run:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories/environment/hosts deploy_app.yml -K
```
Where `environment` is `testing` or `production`.
